## BASICS

### What is accessibility?

Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.

### What are the benefits?

Building accessible sites benefits everyone:

- It addresses Semantic HTML, which also improves SEO, making your site more findable.
- It demonstrates good ethics and morals, which improves your public image.
- It opens up some markets, since more people will be able to access your site.
- It also improves usability for mobile phone users or those on low network speed.
- It is the law in some countries.

### What kinds of disabilities should be considered?

People with disabilities are just as diverse as people without disabilities, and so are their disabilities. The key lesson here is to think beyond your own computer and how you use the web, and start learning about how others use it â€” you are not your users. The main types of disability to consider are explained below, along with any special tools they use to access web content (known as assistive technologies, or ATs).

- **People with visual impairments**: blindness, low-level vision, and color blindness. Many people with visual impairments use screen magnifiers that are either physical magnifiers or software zoom capabilities. Some users will rely on screen readers.
- **People with hearing impairments**: deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) people have various levels of hearing loss ranging from mild to profound. Some do use Assistive Devices. To provide access, textual alternatives must be provided. Videos should be manually captioned, and transcripts should be provided for audio content. Furthermore, due to high levels of language deprivation in DHH populations, text simplification should be considered.
- **People with movement impairments**: physical issues (such as loss of limb or paralysis), or neurological/genetic disorders that lead to weakness or loss of control in limbs. The way this usually affects web development work is the requirement that controls be accessible by the keyboard.
- **People with cognitive impairments**: it refers to a broad range of disabilities. The range includes people with mental illnesses, such as depression and schizophrenia. It also includes people with learning disabilities, such as dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Some common functional problems include difficulty with understanding content, remembering how to complete tasks, and confusion caused by inconsistent webpage layouts. A good foundation for addressing a11y includes:
    - Delivering content in more than one way, such as by text-to-speech or by video.
    - Easily understood content, such as text written using plain-language standards.
    - Focusing attention on important content.
    - Minimizing distractions, such as unnecessary content or advertisements.
    - Consistent webpage layout and navigation.
    - Familiar elements, such as underlined links blue when not visited and purple when visited.
    - Dividing processes into logical, essential steps with progress indicators.
    Website authentication as easy as possible without compromising security.
    Making forms easy to complete, such as with clear error messages and simple error recovery.
