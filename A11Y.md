## BASIC

### 1 What is accessibility?

Accessibility is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.

### 2 What are the benefits?

Building accessible sites benefits everyone:

- It addresses Semantic HTML, which also improves SEO, making your site more findable.
- It demonstrates good ethics and morals, which improves your public image.
- It opens up some markets, since more people will be able to access your site.
- It also improves usability for mobile phone users or those on low network speed.
- It is the law in some countries.

### 3 What kinds of disabilities should be considered?

People with disabilities are just as diverse as people without disabilities, and so are their disabilities. The key lesson here is to think beyond your own computer and how you use the web, and start learning about how others use it â€” you are not your users. The main types of disability to consider are explained below, along with any special tools they use to access web content (known as assistive technologies, or ATs).

- **People with visual impairments**: blindness, low-level vision, and color blindness. Many people with visual impairments use screen magnifiers that are either physical magnifiers or software zoom capabilities. Some users will rely on screen readers.
- **People with hearing impairments**: deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) people have various levels of hearing loss ranging from mild to profound. Some do use Assistive Devices. To provide access, textual alternatives must be provided. Videos should be manually captioned, and transcripts should be provided for audio content. Furthermore, due to high levels of language deprivation in DHH populations, text simplification should be considered.
- **People with movement impairments**: physical issues (such as loss of limb or paralysis), or neurological/genetic disorders that lead to weakness or loss of control in limbs. The way this usually affects web development work is the requirement that controls be accessible by the keyboard.
- **People with cognitive impairments**: it refers to a broad range of disabilities. The range includes people with mental illnesses, such as depression and schizophrenia. It also includes people with learning disabilities, such as dyslexia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Some common functional problems include difficulty with understanding content, remembering how to complete tasks, and confusion caused by inconsistent webpage layouts. A good foundation for addressing a11y includes:
    - Delivering content in more than one way, such as by text-to-speech or by video.
    - Easily understood content, such as text written using plain-language standards.
    - Focusing attention on important content.
    - Minimizing distractions, such as unnecessary content or advertisements.
    - Consistent webpage layout and navigation.
    - Familiar elements, such as underlined links blue when not visited and purple when visited.
    - Dividing processes into logical, essential steps with progress indicators.
    Website authentication as easy as possible without compromising security.
    Making forms easy to complete, such as with clear error messages and simple error recovery.

### 4 What are the four principles of accessibility?

1. **Perceivable**: information and user interface elements must be visible or audible.
2. **Operable**: users must be able to interact with them using their preferred input method.
3. **Understandable**: elements must be clear and easy to use.
4. **Robust**: elements must be compatible with assistive technologies and future-proofed against changes in technology.

### 5 What is WAI-ARIA?

WAI-ARIA means Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications.

WAI-ARIA is a technology that can be used to add extra information about the structure and function of a page. It defines a way to make Web content and Web applications more accessible to people with disabilities.

WAI-ARIA is supported by most modern web browsers, and you can use it to add information such as labels, descriptions, and keyboard shortcuts.

When using WAI-ARIA, you should keep in mind that it is a supplemental technology. This means that it should be used in addition to other accessibility features, such as providing text alternatives for non-text content.

### 6 Why using semantic tags is important?

Semantic tags are helpful for the Screen Readers to identify the right tag and speak aloud to the users.

### 7 What is the WCAG?

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of standards for making web content accessible to people with disabilities. The WCAG is developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an international standards body.

There are three levels of conformance: A, AA, and AAA. The WCAG 2.0 standards are currently the most widely-used guidelines for accessible web design.

The WCAG 2.1 standards were released in June 2018 and are rapidly gaining popularity. The WCAG standards include a wide range of accessibility features, from providing alt text for images to designing pages that can be navigated using only a keyboard.

### 8 AA and AAA

As per WCAG, **AA** is the minimum level to achieve accessibility while **AAA** when building federal web apps. In AAA, the guidelines are stricter.

**Example**

- Color Contrast:
  - In AA, a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.
  - In AAA, a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text.

### 9 Screen Readers

Screen Readers help people who can't see screens access information on computers and phones. The technology reads the screen aloud or converts it to Braille.

The most known SR are:

- **NVDA (Windows)**: it is a basic and usefull Screen Reader for Windows. It is easier to install because it has fewer components than JAWS. It can be run from a USB drive and it is lighter on system resources.
- **JAWS (Windows)**: it is a more complex Screen Reader for Windows. It has the ability to create user definable frames (useful in specific situations), offers a graphics labeller, picture smart and a text analyzer, among other tools.
- **VoiceOver (iOS)**: it is an iOS Accessibility feature that reads screen descriptions aloud so you can use an iPhone without being able to see the screen. VoiceOver also changes the way gestures work on your iPhone, and to turn it off in Settings, you will have to use the new gestures associated with VoiceOver.
- **Orca (Ubuntu)**: it is the default and built in SR of Ubuntu. In order to activate it press it `win+alt+s`.
  - Docs: https://help.gnome.org/users/orca/stable
- **Talkback (Android)**: it is the Google screen reader included on Android devices. TalkBack gives you spoken feedback so that you can use your device without looking at the screen. You can drag one finger around the screen and TalkBack announces the icons, buttons, and other items as you drag your finger over them.

### 10 aXe

It is a DevTools browser extension for a11y. It is a fast, lightweight, yet powerful testing tool driven by the accessibility testing engine, axe-core, developed by Deque.

## INTERMEDIATE

### 12 How do you ensure keyboard accessibility in a web application?

- Implement proper HTML semantics, using focusable elements like buttons and links.
- Confirm the focus ring is visible when the element is focused.
- Use focus trap when needed.
- Ensure the logical order of elements follows the visual layout.
- Test the application with keyboard-only navigation to verify that users can access and interact with all functionality without a mouse.

### 13 Why is important to provide alternative text for images?

Because alternative text enables screen readers to describe images to users with visual impairments, ensuring that everyone can access and understand the content. It also improves the search engine optimization (SEO) and compliance with some legal requirements.

### 14 What is the significance of color contrast?

Color contrast affects the readability and usability of content for users with visual impairments or color deficiencies. Ensuring sufficient contrast between text and background colors improves legibility and also helps prevent eye strain and fatigue, enhancing the user experience.

### 15 How would you approach making a complex data table?

- Use semantic HTML markup such as `<table>`, `<th>`, `<tr>`, and `<td>` elements to define the table structure.
- Implement appropriate table headers (`<th>`) and scope attributes to associate header cells with data cells, ensuring screen readers can convey the relationship.
- Include descriptive and concise captions or summaries to provide context and aid navigation for screen reader users.
- Enhance usability by allowing keyboard navigation and ensuring focus management, making it easier for users to navigate and interact with the table content.

### 16 What is focus management?

It refers to the practice of ensuring that interactive elements on a web page receive keyboard focus in a logical and predictable order. This includes managing the focus state as users navigate through the page using the keyboard, ensuring that focus remains visible and that users can easily identify the currently focused element.

### 17 How to handle form validation and error messages?

- Provide clear and descriptive error messages that explain why the submission failed and how to correct the error.
- Associate error messages with their corresponding form controls using appropriate ARIA attributes or labels to ensure they are announced by screen readers.
- Use visual and auditory cues, such as color changes or aria-live regions, to alert users to validation errors dynamically.
- Ensure that error messages are presented in a consistent location and format, allowing all users, including those using screen readers or assistive technologies, to easily identify and address validation issues.

### 18 How to provide accessible multimedia content?

- Include alternative text (alt text) for images and descriptive captions or transcripts for videos and audio files to ensure content is perceivable by users with visual or auditory impairments.
- Implement keyboard controls and provide accessible player controls for multimedia elements, allowing users to navigate and interact with the content using keyboard shortcuts.
- Ensure that multimedia content complies with accessibility standards, such as WCAG, by providing accessible media players, ensuring compatibility with assistive technologies, and testing for accessibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

### 19 How responsive design contributes to a11y?

Improving readability and usability by adjusting layout, font sizes, and spacing based on viewport size, enhancing the UX for users with visual impairments.

### 20 What are some common misconceptions or myths about a11y?

- Assuming a11y is only relevant for users with disabilities, overlooking the benefits it offers to all users, such as improved usability and search engine optimization.
- Believing that a11y is solely the responsibility of developers rather than a shared responsibility across all stakeholders.
- Thinking that achieving a11y compliance requires sacrificing design aesthetics or compromising functionality.
