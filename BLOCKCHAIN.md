What is a blockchain?

A blockchain is a specific type of database: it stores data in blocks that are chained togehter.

What are the characteristics of a blockchain?

It depends on the implementation. A blockchain could be:

- **Centralized or decentralized.** If there is only one node in the network (the entity that validates the transactions and writes the data to storage), it is centralized. The more number of nodes, the more decentralized the blockchain is.
- **Open or closed.** If the blockchain allows anyone to connect and run a node, then it is open. The more regulations and bans there are for running a node, the more closed the blockchain is.
- **Public or private.** Some information on the blockchain may be public, while some may be private. For example, on the Bitcoin blockchain, the balance of each wallet and its transaction history are public. In contrast, on the Monero blockchain, they are private.
- **Mutable or immutable.** Immutability means that the data entered is irreversible. While it can be argued that there is no absolute immutability, each blockchain uses different mechanisms to make mutability as difficult as possible. For example, bitcoin uses cryptography and the Proof of Work consensus method to make it very very difficult to mutate its blockchain data.

What are the characteristics of the Bitcoin blockchain?

The goal of the Bitcoin blockchain is to be an open and censorship-resistant protocol (communication system). Therefore, it has the following characteristics: it is a decentralized open and public blockchain that uses cryptography and PoW consensus method to aim immutability.
