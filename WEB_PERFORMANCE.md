## BASICS

### 1. What is Web Performance?

Web performance refers to how quickly site content loads and renders in a web browser, and how well it responds to user interaction.

### 2. Why is web performance important?

A better web performance is related to a better user experience. There is a correlation between speed and success of websites in terms of both revenue and usage.

### 3. What are the main factors that affect web performance?

The size of the page, the number of requests, the type and number of resources, and the server response time, among other factors.

### 4. What is the Perceived Performance?

Perceived performance, also known as user-perceived performance, is a measure of how fast a website feels to users, rather than how fast it actually loads. It refers to the amount of time it takes for a user to perceive that a webpage is loading and become usable.

### 5. What is the Perceived Performance related to?

Perceived performance is influenced by various factors such as the time it takes to render the initial content on the page, the responsiveness of the user interface, and the speed with which interactive elements become available.

### 6. How could be Perceived Performance improved?

To optimize perceived performance, web developers can use techniques such as lazy loading, progressive rendering, and prioritizing the loading of critical resources. These techniques can help ensure that users perceive a website to be loading quickly, even if some resources take longer to load in the background.

### 7. Loading Performance VS Render Performance

There are two parts of web performance: loading and render performance.

**Loading Performance**:

- Refers to how long it takes for a website to load all of its resources.
- Influenced by factors such as the size of the files, the speed of the server, and the user's internet connection.
- Typically measured using metrics such as the time to first byte (TTFB), the time to first paint (TTFP), and the time to interact (TTI).
- Optimized using techniques such as caching, minification, compression, and image optimization.

**Render performance**:

- Refers to how quickly a web page is displayed on the user's screen once the resources have finished loading.
- Influenced by factors such as the complexity of the web page, size and number of images and videos, and efficiency of the browser's rendering engine.
- Typically measured using metrics such as first contentful paint (FCP), first meaningful paint (FMP), and time to visually complete (TVC).
- Optimized using techniques such as image optimization, code splitting, lazy loading, optimize JavaScript and optimizing CSS.

### 8. What tools do you use to measure web performance?

There are various tools to measure web performance. For example: Google PageSpeed Insights, GTmetrix, Pingdom, WebPageTest, and Lighthouse. These tools analyze website speed, performance, and provide recommendations for improvement.

### 9. How do you optimize images for the web?

- Reducing the file size without compromising the quality. This can be achieved by using compression tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Squoosh, or TinyPNG.
- Adjusting image dimensions to the required size.
- Removing unnecessary metadata to reduce the file size.
- Choosing the appropriate image format such as JPEG, PNG, or WebP.
- Using responsive images and lazy loading can further optimize web performance.

### 10. How do you reduce the size of CSS and JavaScript files?

- Minification: it is a technique that removes white space and unnecessary characters without altering functionality.
- Concatenation: it is a technique that combines multiple files into a single file, reducing the number of requests required.
- Optimization: unused or duplicate code should be removed.
- Gzip: it is a compression tool.

### 11. How do you handle browser caching?

To handle browser caching, you can set the appropriate HTTP headers to control how long the browser should cache specific resources. Resources that are unlikely to change frequently, such as images, can be set with a longer cache time, while resources that change frequently, such as CSS or JavaScript files, should be set with a shorter cache time. You can also use cache-busting techniques, such as appending a query string to the URL or changing the file name when a resource is updated, to ensure that the browser requests the latest version of the file.

### 12. What is minification and how it can improve web performance?

Minification is the process of removing unnecessary characters, such as white space, comments, and line breaks, from code without changing its functionality. This results in smaller file sizes, leading to faster loading times and improved web performance. Minification is commonly used for CSS and JavaScript files, but can also be applied to HTML and other resources.

### 13. What is the impact of HTTP requests on web performance?

HTTP requests can significantly impact web performance as each request requires a round-trip between the browser and the server. This can result in slower loading times, increased network latency, and lower user engagement. To optimize web performance, you should reduce the number of HTTP requests required by combining resources, using sprites, and leveraging browser caching. It's also important to optimize the order in which resources are loaded, prioritize critical resources, and minimize the use of third-party scripts that require additional HTTP requests.

### 14. What is the impact of using third-party scripts on web performance?

It can impact web performance by increasing the number of HTTP requests required, slowing down page load times, and increasing network latency. Third-party scripts can also introduce dependencies and conflicts, leading to potential security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues.

### 15. Can you explain the concept of lazy loading?

Lazy loading is a technique used to defer the loading of non-critical resources, such as images, until they are needed. This reduces the initial page load time and improves web perceived performance by prioritizing critical resources. When lazy loading is used, only the resources above the fold are loaded initially, and additional resources are loaded as the user scrolls or interacts with the page.

### 16. What is the difference between client-side and server-side caching?

Client-side caching stores resources in the user's browser cache, reducing the number of requests required and improving web performance. Server-side caching, on the other hand, stores resources in the server's cache, reducing the time required to generate a response and reducing the load on the server. Client-side caching is useful for resources that don't change frequently, while server-side caching is useful for dynamic content that is generated frequently. Both client-side and server-side caching can significantly improve web performance when used appropriately.

### 17. What is the role of a Content Delivery Network (CDN) in web performance?

A CDN improves the delivery of content to users. It achieves this by distributing content across multiple servers strategically placed in various geographic locations. The CDN serves content to users from the server closest to their location, reducing latency and improving load times. Additionally, CDNs can cache static content, reducing the load on origin servers and improving overall website performance. CDNs also provide additional features like DDoS protection, SSL encryption, and traffic optimization, contributing to a faster and more reliable browsing experience.

### 18. What are the benefits of using a front-end framework for web performance?

- They often provide optimized and efficient code structures, pre-built components, and performance-focused optimizations.
- They often implement best practices for performance, such as code splitting, lazy loading, and efficient rendering techniques.
- They also provide tools and features for optimizing assets, handling caching, and reducing unnecessary re-renders.

### 19. How do you handle web page optimization for mobile devices?

- Adopt a mobile-first approach by prioritizing essential content and optimizing the layout for smaller screens.
- Minimize the use of large images and unnecessary elements that can impact load times.
- Implement responsive design techniques (such as CSS media queries): it eliminates the need for separate mobile-specific versions of the website, reducing the number of resources that need to be loaded, and avoiding redirects.
- Leverage mobile-specific features like touch events and gestures to enhance user experience: it may not directly improve web performance in terms of resource optimization, but it can contribute to a better overall user experience on mobile devices.

### 20. What is the role of website analytics in web performance optimization?

They provide insights into user behavior, page load times, and performance metrics. They help identify areas for improvement, such as high bounce rates or slow-loading pages, and prioritize optimization efforts. Analytics data can be used to measure the impact of performance optimizations, track improvements over time, and make data-driven decisions to enhance web performance and user experience.

### 21. What is the role of browser rendering and how does it affect web performance?

Browser rendering refers to the process of converting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a visual display on the user's screen. It plays a significant role in web performance as inefficient rendering can lead to slow page rendering and lower user experience. Optimizing browser rendering involves reducing rendering-blocking resources, optimizing CSS delivery, and minimizing JavaScript execution.

### 22. What are the best practices for optimizing server-side performance?

- Efficient database queries.
- Caching.
- Code optimization.
- Load balancing.
- Connection pooling.
- Content compression.
- Asynchronous processing.
- Scalable infrastructure.

  - Minimize HTTP requests.
  - Optimize database queries or server-side operations that may be causing delays.
  - Consider using techniques like code minification, compression, and lazy loading.

### 24. What is the difference between performance and scalability?

Performance is about speed and efficiency, while scalability is about handling growth and capacity without compromising performance.

### 25. How to optimize database performance in a web application?

- Indexing: properly index frequently queried columns to speed up data retrieval.
- Query optimization.
- Database caching.
- Connection pooling.
- Database normalization.
- Database server optimization.
- Regular maintenance: indexing, updating statistics and cleaning up unused data.

### 26. How to leverage serverless architectures to improve web performance?

- Auto-scaling: serverless platforms automatically scale resources based on demand.
- Reduced latency: serverless functions are deployed closer to end-users, reducing network latency and improving response times.
- Efficient resource allocation: serverless platforms handle resource management, allowing developers to focus on code optimization and performance improvements.
- Pay-per-use pricing: with serverless, you only pay for actual usage, which incentivizes optimizing code and reducing unnecessary computations.

### 27. What is critical CSS?

It refers to the minimal CSS needed for the initial page load, improving perceived performance by prioritizing the rendering of visible content. By inlining or loading the critical CSS inline, the page can display faster and provide a better user experience, while non-critical CSS can be loaded asynchronously or deferred.
