## BASICS

### What is Web Performance?

Web performance refers to how quickly site content loads and renders in a web browser, and how well it responds to user interaction.

### Why is web performance important?

A better web performance is related to a better user experience. There is a correlation between speed and success of websites in terms of both revenue and usage.

### What are the main factors that affect web performance?

The size of the page, the number of requests, the type and number of resources, and the server response time, among other factors.

### What is the Perceived Performance?

Perceived performance, also known as user-perceived performance, is a measure of how fast a website feels to users, rather than how fast it actually loads. It refers to the amount of time it takes for a user to perceive that a webpage is loading and become usable.

### What is the Perceived Performance related to?

Perceived performance is influenced by various factors such as the time it takes to render the initial content on the page, the responsiveness of the user interface, and the speed with which interactive elements become available.

### How could be Perceived Performance improved?

To optimize perceived performance, web developers can use techniques such as lazy loading, progressive rendering, and prioritizing the loading of critical resources. These techniques can help ensure that users perceive a website to be loading quickly, even if some resources take longer to load in the background.
