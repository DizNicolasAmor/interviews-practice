### What is the EVM?

EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)

### What is an ABI?

ABI (Application Binary Interface) is an interface between two program modules, often between operating systems and user programs. In the ethereum blockchain, the ABI is an interface that allows humans to interact with the bytecode of deployed smar contracts.

Smart contracts written in high-level languages like Solidity or Vyper need to be compiled in EVM executable bytecode; when a smart contract is deployed, this bytecode is stored on the blockchain and is associated with an address. For Ethereum and EVM, a smart contract is just this sequence of bytecode. To access functions defined in high-level languages, users need to translate names and arguments.

ABI defines the methods and structures used to interact with the binary contract, just like API does but on a lower-level.
