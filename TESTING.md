## BASICS

### What is Software Testing?

Software testing is a process of software development that consists on verifying software correctness, quality, and performance.

It can be said that testing enhances the quality of the product by preventing bugs, reducing development costs, and reducing performance issues.

### What are the benefits of software testing?

- Customer Satisfaction
- Cost Effective
- Quality Product
- Low Failure
- Security
- Early Defect Detection

### What are the principles of software testing?

1. **Absence of errors fallacy**: software needs to be bug-free 99% of the time, and it must also meet all customer requirements.
2. **Testing shows the presence of errors**: but it cannot guarantee that the software is defect-free. Testing can minimize the number of defects, but it can't remove them all.
3. **Exhaustive testing is not possible**.
4. **Defect clustering**: the majority of defects are typically found in a small number of modules in a project. According to the Pareto Principle, 80% of software defects arise from 20% of modules.
5. **Pesticide Paradox**: it is impossible to find new bugs by re-running the same test cases over and over again. Thus, updating or adding new test cases is necessary in order to find new bugs.
6. **Early testing**: in the early stages of development, defects will be detected more easily and at a lower cost.
7. **Testing is context-dependent**: software needs to be tested differently depending on its type.
