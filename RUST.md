## BASICS

### What is Rust, and what makes it different from other programming languages?

Rust is a low-level programming language that was first introduced by Mozilla in 2010. It is designed to be fast, safe, and concurrent, with a focus on performance, memory safety, and thread safety.

One of the main features that sets Rust apart from other programming languages is its ownership system, which enables fine-grained control over memory allocation and deallocation, without the need for a garbage collector. This system helps prevent common errors like null pointer dereferencing and data races, which are often the cause of security vulnerabilities and program crashes in other languages.

Rust offers a number of other advanced features, including pattern matching, closures, traits, and macros, that make it a versatile and powerful language for a wide range of applications. Overall, Rust is a modern programming language that combines performance, safety, and expressiveness.
