## Concepts

### What is CSS?

**Cascading Style Sheets** (CSS) is a simply designed language that allows to apply styles to web pages. It enables to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.

### What are the advantages of using CSS?

- Separation of content from presentation: in this sense it contributes to a cleaner code, faster development, and flexibility for presenting the same content in multiple formats in mobile, desktop or laptop.
- Simplicity of web development and maintainance: it has a simple syntax that could make a huge impact, and also new changes could be atomic (in the sense that adding or removing a selector could be done without refactoring previous code).
- Improvement of bandwidth: the style sheets will be stored in the browser cache and they can be used on multiple pages, without having to download again.
