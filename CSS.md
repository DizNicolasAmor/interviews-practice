## Concepts

### What is CSS?

**Cascading Style Sheets** (CSS) is a simply designed language that allows to apply styles to web pages. It enables to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.

### What are the advantages of using CSS?

- Separation of content from presentation: in this sense it contributes to a cleaner code, faster development, and flexibility for presenting the same content in multiple formats in mobile, desktop or laptop.
- Simplicity of web development and maintainance: it has a simple syntax that could make a huge impact, and also new changes could be atomic (in the sense that adding or removing a selector could be done without refactoring previous code).
- Improvement of bandwidth: the style sheets will be stored in the browser cache and they can be used on multiple pages, without having to download again.

### What are the limitations of CSS?

- Browser Compatibility: some style selectors are supported and some are not. See: https://caniuse.com
- Cross Browser issue: some selectors behave differently in a different browser (IE and Opera support CSS as different logic). I remember having problems with the outline (for the focus ring), floating elements, or the transform property.
- Ascending by selectors is not possible.
- No expressions.
- Pseudo-class not controlled by dynamic behavior.
- Rules, styles, targeting specific text not possible.
