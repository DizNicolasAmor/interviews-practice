## Basics

### What is HTML5?

HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and displaying content on the internet. This includes animations, audio, images, and text, among many other things, and all without the need for additional software. HTML5 is the most recent and most advanced version of HTML.

### What are the differences between HTML and HTML5?

- HTML5 supports video, graphics, and audio, whereas HTML only supports them through third-party extensions.
- HTML5 is mobile-friendly, whereas HTML is not.
- HTML5 is compatible with all major web browsers, whereas HTML is not.
- HTML5 offers several options for local storage, whereas HTML only offers cookies.
- HTML5 supports multi-threading, whereas HTML operates only in one thread.

### What are tags in HTML5?

Tags are pieces of HTML5 code used to define the structure of the page. There are more than 100 tags, each one serving a unique purpose.

### What are the most basic tags?

The most basic tags are `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, and `<body>`.

### What are elements in HTML5?

They are components that instruct the web browser how to structure and interpret the HTML5 document. Typically, they encompass an opening tag, a closing tag, and specified content between the opening and closing tags, depending on the type of tag used.

### What are attributes in HTML5?

Attributes are special properties or characteristics used within an element to modify its behavior. Attributes are specified within the opening tag and must be enclosed in quotation marks.

### Relationship between CSS and HTML5

CSS is a style sheet language used with HTML5 to format and display the elements specified by the markup language for the end user. While HTML5 defines the structure of a page, CSS specifies the document’s style.

### What are most important HTML5 structure elements?

- <header>, containing the header or top of the page
- <footer>, containing the footer or bottom of the page
- <section>, containing one section that is thematically similar to other sections
- <article>, containing standalone content
- <nav>, containing the navigation functionality of the page
- <aside>, containing secondary content

### What are input elements?

Input elements are used to create interactive controls that receive and process information from the user.

### What is meant by web storage in HTML5?

Web storage refers to HTML5’s new storage features. Previous HTML versions relied on cookies for storage in the server, but web storage now means data can be stored locally within the user’s browser. Web storage also offers a larger storage limit and is more secure.

### How do you link to another web page using HTML5?

The anchor tag, or `<a>`, is used with the `href` attribute to link to other web pages.

### What are the three types of lists in HTML5?

- **Ordered list**: which is used to group related items in a specific order.
- **Unordered list**: which is used to group related items in no particular order.
- **Description list**: which is used to group terms and their descriptions.
